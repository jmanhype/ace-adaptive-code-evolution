# ACE: Adaptive Code Evolution - Architecture

This document outlines the architecture of the ACE system, explaining its components, design decisions, and how they work together.

## System Overview

ACE is designed as a modular, extensible system for AI-powered code optimization. It follows a modified hexagonal architecture with clear separation between:

- **Domain Core**: Core entities and business logic
- **Application Services**: Orchestration of operations
- **Infrastructure**: External dependencies (AI, storage, etc.)
- **User Interfaces**: Ways to interact with the system

## Core Domain Model

The core domain model consists of these key entities:

1. **Analysis**: A code analysis session that identifies optimization opportunities
   - Contains metadata about the analyzed code (file path, language)
   - Has settings like focus areas and severity threshold
   - Contains a collection of identified opportunities

2. **Opportunity**: A specific code issue identified during analysis
   - Has a location within the code
   - Categorized by type (performance, maintainability, etc.)
   - Includes severity level and description
   - Contains a rationale explaining why it's an issue
   - May include a suggested change

3. **Optimization**: A generated solution for an opportunity
   - Contains the original and optimized code
   - Associated with a strategy (algorithm or approach used)
   - Includes an explanation of the changes
   - Has a status (pending, applied, rejected)

4. **Evaluation**: Assessment of an optimization's effectiveness
   - Contains metrics comparing the original and optimized versions
   - Includes a success/failure determination
   - Contains a detailed report with analysis

5. **Experiment**: Testing setup for validating optimizations
   - Contains setup for running both original and optimized code
   - Collects metrics for comparison
   - Validates functional correctness

## Service Layer

The service layer orchestrates operations and implements the application's use cases:

1. **Analysis Service**: Handles analyzing code
   - Manages code parsing and processing
   - Orchestrates AI-based analysis
   - Supports custom analyzers

2. **Optimization Service**: Handles optimization generation
   - Manages optimization strategies
   - Generates optimized code implementations
   - Applies changes to files

3. **Evaluation Service**: Handles optimization evaluation
   - Creates and runs experiments
   - Collects and analyzes metrics
   - Determines optimization success

4. **Telemetry**: Tracks metrics and monitoring
   - Records operation timing
   - Tracks success/failure rates
   - Monitors resource usage

## Infrastructure Layer

The infrastructure layer connects to external systems:

1. **AI Providers**: Integration with LLM services
   - Provider-specific API integrations
   - Prompt management
   - Response parsing
   - Error handling

2. **Storage**: Persistence for domain entities
   - Database integration via Ecto
   - Query optimization
   - Transaction handling

3. **Metrics**: Collection and reporting of system metrics
   - Performance metrics
   - Error rates
   - Resource usage

## User Interface Layer

The system exposes functionality through multiple interfaces:

1. **Library API**: Elixir module interface
   - Public functions for programmatic access
   - Macros for defining custom extensions

2. **CLI**: Command-line interface
   - Commands for all core operations
   - Formatted output options
   - Configuration management

3. **HTTP API**: REST interface
   - Endpoints for all operations
   - Authentication and authorization
   - JSON response formatting

## Extensibility Points

ACE is designed to be extended in several ways:

1. **Custom Analyzers**: Define domain-specific code analyzers
   - Register analyzers with specific focus areas
   - Implement domain-specific detection logic

2. **Custom Strategies**: Define specialized optimization strategies
   - Target specific types of optimizations
   - Implement domain-specific transformations

3. **AI Providers**: Add new LLM providers
   - Implement the provider behavior
   - Configure provider-specific settings

4. **Language Support**: Add support for new programming languages
   - Implement language-specific experiment factories
   - Add language-specific optimizations

## Data Flow

A typical optimization flow proceeds through these stages:

1. **Analysis**: Code is analyzed to identify issues
   - Parse and preprocess code
   - Use AI or custom analyzers to identify issues
   - Record and categorize opportunities

2. **Optimization**: Solutions are generated for issues
   - Select appropriate strategy for each opportunity
   - Generate optimized code implementations
   - Record and explain optimizations

3. **Evaluation**: Optimizations are evaluated
   - Set up experiments with original and optimized code
   - Test correctness and measure performance
   - Compare metrics and determine success

4. **Application**: Successful optimizations are applied
   - Apply changes to source code files
   - Record applied changes
   - Provide rollback capability

## Design Decisions

### Why Hexagonal Architecture?

The hexagonal architecture (also known as ports and adapters) was chosen to:
- Isolate the core domain from external dependencies
- Allow easy substitution of infrastructure components
- Enable testing without external dependencies
- Support multiple user interfaces

### Why AI-Powered Analysis?

Traditional static analysis has limitations:
- Requires language-specific implementations
- Often produces many false positives
- Struggles with complex semantic patterns

LLMs offer advantages for code analysis:
- Language-agnostic capabilities
- Contextual understanding of code
- Ability to explain issues and suggest fixes
- Can understand complex patterns

### Why Experimental Evaluation?

Automated evaluation ensures:
- Optimizations maintain correctness
- Performance improvements are measurable
- Changes don't introduce regressions
- Provides confidence in applying changes

## Future Extensions

The architecture supports these future extensions:

1. **Multi-File Optimization**: Analyze and optimize across file boundaries
2. **Continuous Optimization**: Integration with CI/CD pipelines
3. **Learning System**: Improve strategies based on evaluation results
4. **IDE Extensions**: Direct integration with development environments
5. **Team Collaboration**: Review and comment on proposed optimizations

## Conclusion

The ACE architecture is designed to be modular, extensible, and maintainable. It separates concerns appropriately while providing a cohesive system for AI-powered code optimization.
